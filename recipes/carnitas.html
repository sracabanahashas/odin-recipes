    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredients">3 lbs pork shoulder</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1 medium orange</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1 medium white onion</li>
        <li class="ingredients">2-8 cloves garlic to taste</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li class="steps">Cut up the pork. You want 2-3 inch chunks.
            Place in an 8x12 (or similar) baking dish, cover
            with  salt and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li class="steps">Peel the garlic, quarter the onion and orange.
            Squeeze out the orange into the dish, then wedge
            everything in with the pork. Get everything
            packed tight in a single layer.</li>
        <li class="steps">Pour oil over your carnitas mixture <strong>
            to cover</strong> (important!) then cover
            the dish tightly with a lid or foil.</li>
        <li class="steps">Toss that bad boy in the oven for like 3
            hours.</li>
        <li class="steps">Take it out and spread the cooked pork on
            a baking sheet, then skim some of the fat
            from the baking dish and drizzle generously
            over top.</li>
        <li class="steps">Pop that sucker under the broiler, taking
            out and stirring every 3 minutes until 
            your desired crispiness is achieved.</li> 
        <li class="steps">You did it, you magnificent bastard. For
            extra credit, you can take the pan juices
            and blend them up with some cooked tomatillos
            for a nice salsa verde to go on top.</li> 
        <li class="steps">Heat (or make) some tortillas and go to town.
            You know how to eat tacos.
            </li>
    </ol>
