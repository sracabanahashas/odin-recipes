    <p>Eggs fried in butter. The breakfast of champions.
        With this recipe you'll never be more than 5 minutes

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat an 8" nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add a reasonable amount of butter. I do 
            maybe like a half tablespoon. 
        </li>
        <li>Let the butter foam up and spread it around the
            pan with a wooden or silicone utensil.
        </li>
        <li>Once the foam subsides, crack those eggs in there.
        </li>
        <li>Leave them alone until the edges begin to brown.
             Then flip them, either by tossing them in the pan
             or with your utensil.
        </li>
        <li>Let cook for another minute or two, gently pressing on yolk with your
            utensil every once in a while to assess doneness.</li>
            <li>Once the yolk reaches your desired firmness, 
                season with salt and pepper then plate and serve.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy one of the greatest foods known to humankind.</li>
    </ol>
