    <h1 class="page-title">Pour Over Coffee</h1>
    <img class="recipe-photo" src="coffee.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making your own pour over coffee by the cup at 
        home can significantly elevate the taste and
        overall experience of your beans. 
    </p>
    <p>Many coffee enthusiasts will tell you it's 
        required to precisely measure weights and 
        temperatures to get the best and most
        consistent brew. Maybe they're right,
        but I can't be bothered so this recipe
        doesn't require a food scale or fancy
        kettle.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients and Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredients">Single size pour over cone (ceramic or plastic)</li>
        <li class="ingredients">Your favorite 12oz standard coffee mug</li>
        <li class="ingredients">Size 2 cone paper coffee filter </li>
        <li class="ingredients">Electric kettle. If you don't have one 
            you can just boil water in a pot and use
            any vessel with a spout for the pour</li>
        <li class="ingredients">Coffee grinder. Electric is fine, but 
            a burr grinder gives a more consistent
            grind if you happen to have one
        </li>
        <li>A big handful of whole coffee beans</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Start boiling some water. You want a little
            more water than will actually fit in your mug.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Grind your beans. The finer you grind, the 
            longer the coffee will brew and the more 
            concentrated (stronger) it will be. 
            Feel free to experiment on different
            beans with different grinds to get brews you like.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Assemble and warm your coffee system. Put
            the cone on top of your mug and put the filter
            inside, and once the water has cooled slightly
            from boiling pour enough in to fully wet the 
            paper and fill about an inch of your mug. 
            Pick up the mug and swish the water around to 
            distribute the heat around the walls, then
            discard water.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Set your cone back in place and add the 
            ground coffee to the filter. Pour hot water over in a 
            gentle stream, just enough to thoroughly wet 
            the coffee grounds.           </li>
        <li class="steps">Stop and wait 30 seconds. This allows the
            coffee to "bloom", aerating the grounds and
            developing the flavor.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Pour in more water in a spiralling motion to re-saturate
            the grounds and fill the cone, then top off as 
            needed until the brewed coffee fills your mug.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Remove cone and discard filter, then enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
